# Bank Statement Processor

AI-powered local bank statement processing and classification system built with React and TypeScript.

## Project Foundation Setup ✅

This project has been initialized with all the essential dependencies and core interfaces needed for the Bank Statement Processor application.

### Dependencies Installed

- **@tensorflow/tfjs** - Machine learning models for transaction classification
- **pdfjs-dist** - PDF parsing and text extraction
- **tesseract.js** - OCR capabilities for scanned documents
- **dexie** - IndexedDB wrapper for local data persistence
- **papaparse** - CSV parsing for Bank of America CSV statements
- **natural** - Natural language processing for transaction understanding

### Core Interfaces Defined

- **Transaction** - Complete transaction data model with metadata
- **AccountInfo** - Bank account and statement information
- **ExtractionResult** - Results from AI document processing
- **ClassificationResult** - AI transaction classification results
- **ProcessingDecision** - Confidence-based processing decisions

### IndexedDB Schema

The database schema supports:
- **Sessions** - User processing sessions with transactions
- **Files** - Uploaded statement files with metadata
- **Models** - Local ML models for classification
- **Preferences** - User settings and confidence thresholds

### Requirements Addressed

- **8.1** - Local processing without external API calls ✅
- **8.4** - Offline functionality after initial load ✅

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Next Steps

The project foundation is complete. The next task will implement the file upload and validation system (Task 2).

## Privacy & Security

This application processes all banking data locally in the browser. No sensitive financial information is transmitted to external servers, ensuring complete data privacy and security.
